# Did you mean? [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mssola/dym.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mssola/dym) [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/mssola/dym?status.png)](http://godoc.org/github.com/mssola/dym)

This package gets the inspiration from git's "Did you mean this?" feature.
That is, it detects typos and it offers similar words that might be what the
user really wanted to type. This package offers three public methods:

    Similar(dict []string, word string) []string
    SimilarDistance(dict []string, word string, dist int) []string

The first method returns all the words from the given dictionary that are close
to the given word. The second method is identical to the first one but it also
accepts a distance (the number of swaps, additions, deletions, etc. allowed).

## Usage

Here goes an example:

~~~ go
package main

import "github.com/mssola/dym"

func main() {
  a := "thing"
  dict := []string{"thingie", "lala", "ting"}

  results := Similar(dict, a)
  // results now contains: ["thingie", "ting"]
}
~~~
